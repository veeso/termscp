      "wallOfText": "Termscp is an application that is still in its early stage of development, the first version has been released in december in 2020 and practically there's only one guy working on it and there's still a lot of work to do in order to improve it and make it fast and reliable. Along to this, you should also consider that since it's an application which works with network protocols and is intended to manipulate secrets and credentials there may always be a security issue. I can't guarantee there's no security issues in the versions I've released in these months, and if there are they might not be even my fault, but they might be contained in the libraries termscp relies on. Because of this, it's always VERY important to keep termscp up to date. To prove how much I care about it, just consider that I've implemented something that many other open source applications won't do: the update check. Whenever you start termscp (unless if deactivated in configuration) termscp will always check if there's a new version available and will notify you immediately. In addition to security concerns, each major update will bring many awesome features ðŸ¦„ you can't miss and the application is getting more reliable and stable after each update ðŸ˜„",
