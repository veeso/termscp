## 0.3.1

Released on 18/01/2021

- **Keyring to store secrets**
  - On both MacOS and Windows, the secret used to encrypt passwords in bookmarks it is now store in the OS secret vault. This provides much more security to store the password

  - Added connection timeout to 30 seconds to SFTP/SCP clients and improved name lookup system.
- Bugfix:
  - Solved index in explorer files list which was no more kept after 0.3.0
  - SCP file transfer: fixed possible wrong file size when sending file, due to a possible incoherent size between the file explorer and the actual file size.
- Breaking changes: on **MacOS / Windows systems only**, the password you saved for bookmarks won't be working anymore if you have support for the keyring crate. Because of the migration to keyring, the previously used secret hasn't been migrated to the storage, instead a new secret will be used. To solve this, just save the bookmark again with the password.
