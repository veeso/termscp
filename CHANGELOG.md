## 0.18.0

Released on 31/07/2025

- [Issue 340](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/340): Replaced the `Exec` popup with a **fully functional terminal emulator** embedded thanks to [A-Kenji's tui-term](https://github.com/a-kenji/tui-term).
- [Issue 345](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/345): Default keys are used from `~/.ssh` directory if no keys are resolved for the host.
- **Updated dependencies** and updated the Rust edition to `2024`

## 0.17.0

Released on 24/03/2025

- **Queuing transfers**:
  - the logic of selecting files has been extended!
  - From now on selecting file will put the files into a **transfer queue**, which is shown on the bottom panel.
  - When a file is selected the file is added to the queue with a destination path, which is the **current other explorer path at the moment of selection.**
  - It is possible to navigate to the transfer queue by using `P` and pressing `ENTER` or `DELETE` on a file will remove it from the transfer queue.
  - Other commands will work as well on the transfer queue, like `COPY`, `MOVE`, `DELETE`, `RENAME`.
- [issue 308](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/308): added `--wno-keyring` flag to disable keyring
- [issue 316](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/316): Local directory path is not switching to what's specified in the bookmark. Now the local directory path is correctly set following this hierarchy:
    1. Local directory path specified for the host bridge
    2. Local directory path specified in the bookmark
    3. Working directory
- [issue 317](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/317): the return value of `--version` should be `0`
- [issue 319](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/319): fixed a crash when the local directory specified in the auth form does not exist
- [issue 327](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/327): fixed a panic when trying to go up from local directory on localhost in the auth form
- [issue 330](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/330): add suppaftp/pavao/kube to allowed logs
- Dependencies:
  - `argh` to `0.1.13`
  - `bytesize` to `2`
  - `dirs` to `6`
  - `magic-crypt` to `4`
  - `notify` to `8`
  - `ssh2-config` to `0.4`
  - `remotefs-ssh` to `0.6`
  - `rust` edition to `2024`

## 0.16.1

Released on 12/11/2024

- Just fixed this: e45c3d5b4ef64653e5b6cc4f3703e3b67514306d
  - `fix: gg rust 1.82 for introducing a nice breaking change in config which was not mentioned in changelog`

## 0.16.0

Released on 14/10/2024

- [**Multi Host support**](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/285):
  - Now it is possible to work on two different remotes `remote A -> remote B` instead of just `localhost -> remote`
  - Cli arguments now accept an additional `remote-args` for the left panel.
  - For more details read this issue <https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/285>.
  - Change between auth forms with `<BACKTAB>`
  - Bookmarks are automatically loaded into the last auth form.
- [Issue 289](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/289): Use `uzers` instead of the dead package `users` which has several vulnerabilities
- [Issue 290](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/290): Password prompt was broken
- [Issue 298](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/298): tuirealm 2.x
  - Fixed some performance issues where sometimes the app froze for a couple of seconds, thanks to this <https://github.com/veeso/tui-realm/pull/78>.
- [Issue 292](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/292): New version alert was not displayed due to a semver regex issue.
- [Issue 291](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/291): Show `..` directory before all the others in the explorer. If you click on it you'll go the parent directory (same as pressing `<U>`). No, you can't select it for transfers and it's actually been implemented in the worse way possible, because this little change would require a huge refactoring of the explorer component. I promise I will do it one day, but I dunno when.
- Logging: filter out messages not related to termscp or remotefs

## 0.15.0

Released on 03/10/2024

- [Issue 249](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/249): The old *find* command has been replaced with a brand new explorer with support to ü™Ñ **Fuzzy search** ü™Ñ. The command is still `<F>`.

  - Pod and container argumets have been removed; from now on you will connect with the following syntax to the provided namespace: `/pod-name/container-name/path/to/file`
- [Issue 279](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/279): do not clear screen
- [Issue 277](https://github.com/veeso/termscp/issues/277): Fix a bug in the configuration page, which caused being stuck if the added SSH key was empty

## 0.3.1

Released on 18/01/2021

- **Keyring to store secrets**
  - On both MacOS and Windows, the secret used to encrypt passwords in bookmarks it is now store in the OS secret vault. This provides much more security to store the password

  - Added connection timeout to 30 seconds to SFTP/SCP clients and improved name lookup system.
- Bugfix:
  - Solved index in explorer files list which was no more kept after 0.3.0

- Breaking changes: on **MacOS / Windows systems only**, the password you saved for bookmarks won't be working anymore if you have support for the keyring crate. Because of the migration to keyring, the previously used secret hasn't been migrated to the storage, instead a new secret will be used. To solve this, just save the bookmark again with the password.
